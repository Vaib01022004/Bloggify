# Bloggify
Personal Blog Website
Bloggify is a Blog style personal journal web application created using by leveragaing java servlets for backend and database connectivity and JSPs for frontend. 

## Design Patterns used, advantages leveraged: 

### 1. Model View Controller
We have used the Model View Controller (MVC) software design pattern to implement this project to separate the business logic from the presentation logic. This helped us to get a clean and simplified design of the web app and also allowed us to modify the presentation logic without interfereing with the backend. We were also able to easily integrate newer features into application without disturbing the existing functionalities.


### 2.Data Abstraction Object
On the other hand we have used Data Abstraction Object (DAO) another software design pattern which helped us to abstract away the implementation details of the data base and also provides us with an additional layer of security as it prevents users from directly interacting with the database. 

### The following diagram illustrates how the MVC architecture and DAO compliment each other and how theyre used.
